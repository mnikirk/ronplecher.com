        <h2 class="text-heading">About Ron Plecher</h2>

        <p>Originally from California and Seattle, Ron moved to his wife Regan's hometown of Bloomington in 1990. He loves this university town that features both big city and small town benefits, with Broadway performances on the one hand, and neighborhood Little League on the other. Ron, Regan, their oldest son, daughter in-law, and grandson all live in Bloomington. His hockey-loving youngest son is in college in Minnesota.</p>
        <p>Ron is an accomplished guitar player who enjoys the vibrant local music scene. He loves to cook, and he and Regan enjoy riding their tandem bicycle in our bike friendly community. His family (which includes his Sheltie and Siamese cat) is the number one thing in his life.</p>
        <p>Before becoming a real estate professional in 2002, Ron had been a business manager for two medical practices.</p>
        <p>Since joining RE/MAX, Ron has been a top producer every year. He's earned multiple awards, including the RE/MAX Chairman's Club and RE/MAX Lifetime Achievement awards, is a member of the RE/MAX Hall of Fame and is a RE/MAX Platinum Club member. Only 1.5% of RE/MAX agents nationwide have ever achieved RE/MAX Chairman's Club status.</p>
        <p>Ron credits his success to his knowledge of real estate and the local market, his attention to detail, his work ethic, his respect for his clients and of course the fact he has the best licensed assistant ever, Connie! You can be sure you are in good hands when you work with Ron .</p>
