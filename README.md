This is only part of the site.  I did a ground-up re-coding of the main webpage per client's design, but a large portion of the live website is an IDX feed for all local real estate listings.  The IDX backend code is *not* mine so I have not included it, but I did go through it file by file to update to modern HTML and CSS.  The IDX code itself is an old heap of ASP Classic al dente.  I can't write ASP Classic but I can give it a facelift and lipo off a few pounds.  Anyway, the listings are pretty now, and you can go see them on the live site.

*HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, ASP Classic*
